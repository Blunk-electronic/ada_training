# About this Demo Program

This demo program demonstrates how to realize fundamental things that are
required for a canvas of a CAD-system. These are the core topics:

- zoom-in/out effects
- scrolled window
- scrollbars
- displaying objects to scale
- drawing frame and title block
- y-axis going upwards
- cursor
- coordinates and distances displaying
- conversions between real world, model and canvas
- primitve draw operations

This is a screenshot of the demo program. It shows some useless
dummy objects.
