# About this Demoprogram

This demoprogram demonstrates how to realize fundamental things that are
required for a canvas of a CAD-system:

- zoom-in/out effects
- scrolled window
- scrollbars
- displaying objects to scale
- drawing frame
- y-axis going upwards
- cursor
- coordinates and distances displaying
- conversions between real world, model and canvas
- primitve draw operations

This is a screenshot of the demo program. It shows some useless
dummy objects.

# The Book
It is impossible to write down all the ideas behind, the concept and the principles 
in comments among the code. For this reason everything is explained in detail 
in a textbook.
