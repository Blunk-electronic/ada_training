# Training files for Ada courses

This repository provides:
- a collection of example programs to learn Ada
- installation scripts to install Gtkada. Gtkada is required if you want to make nice graphical user interfaces.

## Example programs
Change into directory src. There you will find a growing collection of examples. Most of them can be compiled
with the standard make program. Examples which demonstrate graphical user interfaces require the installation
of package gtkada.

## Gtkada installation
See [gtkada-installation.md](gtkada-intallation.md) for details.
